# ðŸ“° Fake News Classification using Machine Learning and NLP

This project demonstrates how to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The solution helps tackle the widespread issue of misinformation by leveraging data science and AI to detect unreliable news content.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Preprocess and clean the news text data
- Explore and visualize the dataset
- Implement and evaluate different machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Display performance metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Provide confidence score for predictions
- Visualize results using Confusion Matrices and ROC Curves

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of labeled news articles containing two classes:
- **Real** news
- **Fake** news

You can find the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) or include it in your repo as `news.csv`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC Score
